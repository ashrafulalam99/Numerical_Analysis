# Root-Finding Methods

This repo contains C++ implementations of:

- **Newton–Raphson** – Fast, requires derivative.
- **Regula Falsi (False Position)** – Uses secant line, guaranteed if sign change exists.
- **Bisection** – Simple and always converges for sign change, slower.
- **Gauss Elimination** – Solves systems of linear equations using row reduction.
- **Gauss Elimination with Pivoting** – More stable version that swaps rows to avoid small pivot.
